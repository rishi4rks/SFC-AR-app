# Augmented Reality App 

This app is for displaying all the stationary items (eg: pencil, eraser, Drawing book etc. in 3D) present in the kit, to the customer once they point their camera towards the SFC logo.

Note: The app is build completely but there is still an bug because of which the camera doesn't opens up when the app launches.
